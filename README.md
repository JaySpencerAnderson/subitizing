# Subitizing 
## The ability to recognize a small number of objects without counting them.

Most people can recognize 1 to 4 objects without having to count them.  These numbers
can all be recognized within similar amounts of time.  More objects however require more
time to recognized for each additional object.

I wrote a little page to see if I could improve my skill at this.

The web page which this documents measures the average amount of time taken to recognize
the numbers 1 through 9.  Only 3 numbers are tested at a time so that finger movement remains
a small portion of the total time taken.  This program works either with the numeric keypad 
or the numbers at the top of the keyboard.  A specific number of objects is presented in 
different patterns to prevent cheating (for instance by keying off one spot).

My personal performance seems independent of which hand I use, but I'm somewhat ambidextrous.
My performance definitely degrades starting with 5 objects, pretty consistently taking longer 
than a second.
